AI Dataset Builder for Model Training project
Project Structure
We'll structure the project into the following directories:
CopyEdit
ai-dataset-builder/
├── benchmarks/
├── curated_code/
├── refined_code/
├── tests/
├── scripts/
└── README.md
Each directory will serve a specific purpose:
•	benchmarks/: Code to measure performance (e.g., execution time, memory usage).
•	curated_code/: Human-curated code snippets with annotations.
•	refined_code/: AI-generated code, improved and documented.
•	tests/: Unit tests for validating the code.
•	scripts/: Scripts to handle dataset generation and evaluation.
